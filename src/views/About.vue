    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am a software engineering student from General Assembly with over a decade in the brewing and distilling industry, where I was responsible for the creation of award-winning products.
Coming from this industry, I am no stranger to problem-solving, effective communication and high standards of work.
I have always held a keen interest in technology and now seek to engage with larger, more complex issues.
Now looking for a challenge where I can combine my newfound technical skills and contribute to a team that values collaboration, culture and harmony.</p>
